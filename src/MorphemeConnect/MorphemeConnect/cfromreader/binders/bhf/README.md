Format Name: BHF Extension: *.bhd Magic: "BHF3", "BHF4"

BHF files (.bhd) are headers for split archive files. They require a corresponding BDF (.bdt) formatted file which contains the data. Distinguishable from DVDBND files as those have a 5 at the end of their extension and magic bytes.

Remember it as "Binary Header File"!
